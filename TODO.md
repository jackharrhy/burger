main:
- we have multiplayer, yay!
- we don't have level
- we don't have camera
- we don't have interpolation
- once we have level:
  - we will want to bump into walls, clientside rapier physics
  - interact sent to server side, maybe server also physics just for collision? in shared?
  - patties
  - cooking
- howler
- dockerized

qwirks:
- myeid set incorrectly sometimes?
- we're not cleaning up entities / using entity versioning or anything, should we?
